// High-level, business-friendly spec for the first-time onboarding v2 workflow.
//
// For the identity-first Arc model and the tap-only FTUE question set that this
// workflow should implement, see `docs/arc-aspiration-ftue.md`. That doc
// defines the gold-standard 5-factor model (domain of becoming, motivational
// style, signature trait, growth edge, everyday proud moment) and how to
// synthesize `Arc.name` and `Arc.narrative` from those answers.
//
// IMPORTANT: This file is the **source of truth** for the v2 onboarding flow.
// - Product / business folks should primarily edit THIS file:
//   - Add / remove / reorder steps in the `steps` array.
//   - Tighten the per-step `prompt` text to control what the agent says.
//   - Adjust simple UI details for form steps (field labels, placeholders).
// - The runtime does not currently read this file directly. Instead, the active
//   FTUE implementation in `firstTimeOnboardingWorkflow.ts` and
//   `IdentityAspirationFlow.tsx` mirrors this spec. Keep this spec as the
//   product-facing source of truth, and update the runtime definitions to match
//   when making significant changes.
//
// When creating a NEW workflow in the future:
// 1. Create a new file next to this one, e.g.
//      `workflowSpecs/myNewWorkflowSpec.ts`
//    exporting a `WorkflowSpec` with an `id`, `outcomeSchema`, and `steps`.
// 2. In `src/domain/workflows.ts`, import your spec and add a small compiler
//    (similar to `compileFirstTimeOnboardingV2Spec`) that maps StepSpec → WorkflowStep.
// 3. Register the compiled `WorkflowDefinition` in `WORKFLOW_DEFINITIONS`.
// 4. Point the relevant host UI (e.g. AgentWorkspace caller) at your workflow ID.

Making reminds me that growth isn\'t only intellectual. It\'s slow, physical, patient, and grounded. It teaches me presence. It teaches me to notice details. It teaches me to treat materials with respect."\n\nExample 3 - Venture / Entrepreneurship:\nName: "🚀 Venture / Entrepreneurship"\nNarrative: "I want to build ventures that are principled, thoughtful, and genuinely helpful. Entrepreneurship is not about speed or hype for me—it\'s about stewarding ideas that could make people\'s lives more coherent, more peaceful, or more empowered.
