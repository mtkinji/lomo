## Goal quality guide (30–90 day goals)

This doc defines what “great” looks like for a Kwilt **Goal** (a 30–90 day focus that lives inside an Arc, or can be attached later).

For the deeper, research-backed “why” and additional templates, see:
- `docs/goal-creation-best-practices.md`

### What a great goal is

A great goal is:

- **One thing**: a single focus, not a bundle of unrelated outcomes.
- **Concrete**: you can tell what “progress” means without interpretation. (Specific, challenging goals generally outperform vague “do your best” goals; see Locke & Latham, 2002.)
- **Right-sized**: realistically achievable in ~30–90 days (not a multi-year identity arc, not a tiny task).
- **Grounded in context**: fits the chosen Arc’s storyline and the user’s current season/constraints.
- **Written in human language**: no corporate jargon; uses the user’s words when possible.

### Quick rubric (use as a checklist)

Score each 0–2 (0 = missing, 1 = partial, 2 = strong):

- **Specific outcome**: Is the outcome clear and observable?
- **Timeboxed**: Is the timeframe implied or explicit (4–12 weeks)?
- **Identity alignment**: Does it belong in the Arc it’s placed in?
- **Realism**: Is it plausible given typical time/energy constraints?
- **Next-step clarity**: Does it imply a clear direction for activities without becoming an activity plan?

### Common failure modes to avoid

- **Too vague**: “Be healthier”, “Level up my career”, “Reflect more”.
- **Not actually a goal** (it’s an activity): “Journal every day”, “Go to the gym 3x/week”.
- **A multi-project plan**: “Ship the app, start marketing, and hire a team”.
- **Too big for 90 days**: “Become a great leader”, “Change my entire lifestyle”.
- **Detached from the user’s prompt**: goal content doesn’t match what the user asked for.

### Examples (good)

#### Example: product / shipping

- **Title**: Ship Kwilt MVP to TestFlight
- **Description**: Over the next 6–8 weeks, ship a TestFlight build of Kwilt that supports onboarding, creating one Arc + one Goal, and adding activities—so I can get real feedback from a small group of early users.

Why it’s good: one clear outcome (TestFlight build), timeboxed, measurable, implies activities (feature work + feedback loop) without listing tasks.

#### Example: craft / skill

- **Title**: Build a consistent weekly writing rhythm
- **Description**: Over the next 8 weeks, publish 6 short essays (500–900 words) so I’m practicing the full loop from idea → draft → share without waiting for “perfect”.

#### Example: relationships

- **Title**: Rebuild closeness with my brother
- **Description**: Over the next 6 weeks, have 4 intentional catch-ups with my brother (calls or in-person) and end each one with a small next touchpoint, so our relationship feels warm and present again.

### Examples (bad → why)

- **Bad**: “Reflect on my experiences from the first time I played with my team.”
  - Too vague, not timeboxed, not an outcome, unclear what “done” means.
